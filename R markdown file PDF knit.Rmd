## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdow           n.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r helloAayush, echo=FALSE}
print("Hello world BY Aayush")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

4. Superscripting can be done by using ^64^
5. To **Strikethrough** use ~ , for example ~~veg~~.
6. Hperlink i.e. to add a link use [link] for instance to addd a link to  [My Linkedin.](www.linkedin.com/in/aayush28/)
